# CardTamperingUsingComputerVision :

This Project is to detect tampering of PAN card using Computer Vision. This project will help different organisation in detecting whether the ID provided to them is by Employee/Coustomer is original or not.
For this project we will calculate the structural similarity of original PAN card and the PAN card uploaded by the user.


Summary

Here we can say the following Conclutions:

1. SSIM index is 31.2% which says that there is difference between the Original image and the Image provided. By which we can conclude that the image provided by the user is tampered.
2. While Contours did not give us any possible difference in between original and tampered images, Threshold and Differnce Images pointed out to great extend the differnces between the Images.
   This was helpful to compare the Images and make a decision on whether the image is tampered or not.
